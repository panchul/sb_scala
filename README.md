# sb_scala
Scala sandbox for variety of templates, and tutorial snippets.

This repository could be a useful starting point for writing Scala code, or demoing how to do it.
It could be used on its own, or deployed on a virtual machine within the workspace [https://github.com/panchul/workspace](https://github.com/panchul/workspace)

The ```/doc``` folder of the ```workspace``` repo has the documentation. 

I will gradually migrate the notes I have to this repository. To keep track of what I am adding:

+ uuid_producer_consumer
    - Demoes how to create actors to produce/consume tokens.
      (To run, install ```sbt``` and run ```sbt reload clean compile run``` in that folder)
